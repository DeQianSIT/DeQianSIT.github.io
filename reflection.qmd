## 🤖 Reflection on the Use of GenAI in My Website Development

### **Introduction: Embracing AI as a Learning Partner**

Throughout the development of this Quarto website portfolio, I actively utilized **ChatGPT (specifically DeepSeek)** as my primary GenAI tool. This reflection documents my experience, insights, and lessons learned about integrating artificial intelligence into academic and creative work.

## 🛠️ **Why I Chose ChatGPT/DeepSeek**

**Accessibility & Context Understanding:** I selected ChatGPT because it demonstrated exceptional understanding of **technical documentation** (Quarto, R, Markdown) while maintaining conversational clarity. Unlike specialized coding assistants, it could help with everything from YAML configurations to content creation and troubleshooting.

**Comprehensive Support:** The tool provided **end-to-end assistance**:
- Technical implementation (Quarto website setup)
- Content generation (project narratives)
- Code debugging (R visualization errors)
- Design suggestions (website structure)
- Learning explanations (Markdown syntax)
