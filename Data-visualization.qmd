## Data Visualization: Insurance Claims Analysis Dashboard

### The Story Behind This Visualization

**Context:** During my Financial Business Informatics diploma at Temasek Polytechnic (Year 3, Semester 2), I undertook a **Capstone Project** with a major Singaporean insurer. The project aimed to analyze 3 years of motor insurance claims data to identify patterns and optimize premium pricing strategies.

**Course:** FIN3201 - Business Intelligence & Analytics  
**Duration:** 4-month industry project  
**Team:** 3 students + 2 industry mentors  
**Dataset:** 45,000+ motor insurance claims (2019-2021) worth SGD 120+ million

**The Challenge:** The insurer's pricing team relied on **static Excel reports** that showed basic aggregates (total claims, average cost) but couldn't reveal:
1. Temporal patterns (seasonal, weekly, hourly trends)
2. Geographic hotspots for accidents
3. Vehicle-specific risk profiles
4. Correlations between multiple variables

My task was to create an **interactive dashboard** that transformed raw claims data into actionable insights for their actuarial team.

## Visualization Rationale & Design Decisions

### Why an Interactive Dashboard?
Traditional static charts (bar, line, pie) failed to show the **multi-dimensional relationships** in the data. I chose a **dashboard approach** with linked visualizations because:

1. **Multi-variable Analysis:** Claims data has 15+ dimensions (time, location, vehicle type, driver age, weather, etc.)
2. **Exploratory Nature:** Different stakeholders needed different views (actuaries vs. operations vs. marketing)
3. **Drill-down Capability:** From high-level trends to individual claim details
4. **Comparative Analysis:** Side-by-side comparison of different segments

### Chart Selection Rationale

| Chart Type | Purpose | Data Encoded |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| Heat Map | Show geographic accident hotspots | Location coordinates, claim frequency, claim severity |
| Time Series Chart | Show temporal patterns | Date/time, claim count, average cost |
| Sunburst Diagram | Hierarchical breakdown | Vehicle type, Make, Model, Age |
| Scatter Plot Matrix | Correlation analysis | 6 key variables simultaneously |
| Parallel Coordinates | Multi-dimensional profiling | 8+ risk factors per claim |
