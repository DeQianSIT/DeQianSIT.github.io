This followed the Single Responsibility Principle from software engineering, allowing each validation rule to be developed, tested, and maintained independently. The architecture enabled:\n\nRule Isolation: Each MAS Notice requirement (e.g., solvency ratios, premium accuracy thresholds, claims reporting standards) became a standalone validation module\nParallel Development: Multiple team members could work on different regulatory modules simultaneously\nHot-swappable Updates: New MAS regulations could be added without disrupting existing validation workflows"
