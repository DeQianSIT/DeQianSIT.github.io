## MAS Insurance Department: Automated Data Validation System

### Project Overview
**Organization:** Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) - Insurance Department  
**Duration:** June 2022 - December 2022 (6 months internship)  
**Role:** Automation Developer & Business Analyst  
**Team:** 4-member cross-functional team (Business Users, IT, Compliance)

### Problem Statement
The Insurance Department manually validated **1,200+ monthly regulatory submissions** from 80+ insurance companies. Each submission required:
- 45-60 minutes of manual checking
- Cross-referencing against 15+ data sources
- Compliance with 7 different regulatory frameworks
- **Monthly total:** 900+ human-hours with 8-12% error rate

### My Solution
I designed and implemented a comprehensive **Python-based automated validation system** employing a **rule-based validation engine** that transformed the entire regulatory compliance workflow. The solution was architected around three core theoretical frameworks:

## 1. Modular Validation Architecture
The system was built on a **modular validation architecture** where each regulatory requirement was encapsulated as an independent validation module. This followed the **Single Responsibility Principle** from software engineering, allowing each validation rule to be developed, tested, and maintained independently. The architecture enabled:

- **Rule Isolation:** Each MAS Notice requirement (e.g., solvency ratios, premium accuracy thresholds, claims reporting standards) became a standalone validation module
- **Parallel Development:** Multiple team members could work on different regulatory modules simultaneously
- **Hot-swappable Updates:** New MAS regulations could be added without disrupting existing validation workflows

## 2. Multi-Source Data Integration Framework
I implemented a **unified data integration framework** that created a single source of truth by harmonizing data from 15+ disparate sources. The framework employed:

- **Data Normalization Algorithms:** Standardized varying data formats from different insurance companies into a common schema
- **Temporal Alignment Techniques:** Synchronized data across different reporting periods and fiscal calendars
- **Reference Data Management:** Created a master reference database for cross-validation against authoritative sources like IRAS tax data, ACRA corporate records, and MAS's internal regulatory database
